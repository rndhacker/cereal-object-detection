# Interview project by Kevin J

This project does object detection for cereals using a custom 
TensorFlowLite model.

The app detects a single object by default, but it is possible to detect 
more than one at the time. Click on the settings icon on the top right, 
then Enable multiple objects.
This app also works with the frontal camera.
